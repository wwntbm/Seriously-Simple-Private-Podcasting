# Seriously Simple Private Podcasting

A handful of tweaks to the [Serious Simple Podcasting](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/) plugin to:

1. Allow private podcasting
   1. Use the “private” status to keep podcasts accessible only to logged-in users.
   2. Include private podcasts in the feed (the feed should be password-protected).
   3. Allow subscribers to see private podcasts.
2. Display podcast dates in the admin.
